# stannis: R package combining Stan and the efficient importance sampling type correction MCMC for Poisson time series

This R package provides a small comparison between different MCMC algorithms for the Bayesian inference of structural time series with Poisson distributed observations, and implements a hybrid algorithm using Stan with combination with importance sampling type correction of MCMC suggested by Vihola, Helske, and Franks (2016) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02541).

See vignette for details, and [the poster from UseR!2017](https://github.com/helske/stannis/blob/master/stannis.pdf) for quick preview.
