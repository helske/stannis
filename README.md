# stannis: R package combining Stan and the efficient importance sampling type correction MCMC for Poisson time series

This R package provides a demonstration of Bayesian inference of structural time series with Poisson distributed observations, 
using Stan with combination with importance sampling type correction of MCMC suggested by Vihola, Helske, and Franks (2016) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02541).

See vignette for details, and upcoming poster in UseR!2017.
