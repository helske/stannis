Description: Bayesian analysis of exponential family state space models where 
  the state dynamics are Gaussian but the observational density is either 
  Gaussian, Poisson, binomial, or negative binomial. The novel approach used by 
  the stannis package is based on the combination of fast Gaussian approximation, 
  efficient No-U-Turn sampler provided by Stan, and the parallelisable 
  importance sampling type corrected Markov chain Monte Carlo approach.
